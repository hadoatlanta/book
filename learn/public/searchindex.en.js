Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format plain text documents.\nWrite docs for your GitHub projects, edit your GitHub profile README etc. You fill find it all here.\nLet‚Äôs dive into it. ‚§µÔ∏è\nTable of Contents ‚¨áÔ∏è The Only Markdown Cheatsheet You Need - ‚ö†Ô∏è Note What is Markdown?

[^1] Hope you will like it. [^see] Jump to section Horizontal Line HTML - Section with some ID Paragraph By writing regular text you are basically writing a paragraph.\nThis is a paragraph. This is a paragraph.\nHeadings There are 6 heading variants. The number of ‚Äú#‚Äù symbols, followed by text, indicates the importance of the heading.\n# Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 ##### Heading 5 ###### Heading 6 Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.\nUsing two asterisks **this text is bold**. Two underscores __work as well__. Let's make it *italic now*. You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_. Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely. What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.\nHere is the syntax.\n![text if the image fails to load](auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image \"Text displayed on hover\") [logo]: auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image \"Hover me\" ![error text][logo] Links Similar to images, links can also be inserted directly or by creating a reference.

You can also define programming language you were using in your snippet. All by using backticks.\nI created `.env` file at the root. Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` `` ``` { learning: \"Markdown\", showing: \"block code snippet\" } ``` ```js const x = \"Block code snippet in JS\"; console.log(x); ``` I created .env file at the root. Backticks inside backticks? `No problem.`\n{ learning: \"Markdown\", showing: \"block code snippet\" } const x = \"Block code snippet in JS\"; console.log(x); Lists As you can do in HTML, Markdown allows creating of both ordered and unordered lists.\nOrdered List 1.
